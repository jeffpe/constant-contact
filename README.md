constant-contact
================

Pulls summary statistics for Constant Contact blasts within a date period.

Start date is based on Constant Contact modified date. So if you resend without copying I am not sure what will happen.

It does pull the forwards, but I did not include them in the results summary. No one forwards my email :(

You should probably puts API keys and Tokens in yaml file or something more secure.
